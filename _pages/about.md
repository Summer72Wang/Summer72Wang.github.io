Hello! My name is Xia (Summer) Wang (王夏), and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Jonathan Sprinkle](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HNJQS0gAAAAJ&hl=en). I am part of the Compositional Systems Lab (CSL), which focuses significantly on the intersection of control, operation, and sensing with computing.

My research interests include: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Autonomous Vehicles, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Mining, and Formal Methods. I am honored to be a [student researcher](https://circles-consortium.github.io/about.html) on the [CIRCLES](https://circles-consortium.github.io/) project and participated in the experiment involving [100 AI-powered cruise control cars](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/2022/11/23/ai-powered-cruise-control-system-may-pave-the-way-to-fuel-efficiency-and-traffic-relief/). Additionally, I designed user cases and developed functions for [CPS-VO](https://cps-vo.org/) and [S&CC-VO](https://sccvo.org/), aiming at fostering collaboration among CPS professionals in academia, government, and industry.

I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees (B.S. in Information System and Information Management and M.S. in Management Science and Engineering) from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics in Shanghai, China. I also have eight years of industry experience in recommender system algorithm development, auditing, and banking.
